# computer_security_User_Authentication
This is Assignment 2 of Computer Security Module and contains multiple simple exercises to demonstrate the following:
1. Week17 - This week covers some password cracking exercises
2. Week18 - This week covered some exercises about different methods of user authentication
3. Week19 - This week covers exercises which are beyond user authentication, including Message Authentication with HMAC (Hash-based message          authentication code),Needham Schroeder Protocol, Demonstrating an attack on Needham Schroeder Protocol
4. Week20 - This week covers setting Linux file and folder permissions.

### The Code

This code is written in Python 3.10 (using PyCharm IDE)

### Running The Code
*To run the code, open the terminal and go to the directory where the code resides and run the code files individually.
For example to run W17Q1.py
 python W17Q1.py


*The files are self-contained and all necessary libraries are imported.


### What is in the code
The code is dividing into two parts:
Part1 - contains exercises demonstrating simple user authentication, password cracking exercises. (For more information , check the attached weekly brief).
Part 2 - contains an advanced exercise which is Fixing Needham-Schroeder protocol to save from Replay attacks by introducing timestamp and extra nounces to verify users.

-as2634_task4a contains the proof that Naive RSA is insecure with respect to an IND-CCA

-as2634_task4b contains the proof that Goldwasser-Micali encryption scheme is insecure with respect to an IND-CCA adversary.
